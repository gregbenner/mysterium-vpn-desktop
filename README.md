## Logging

### App

In development mode, application logs are printed to the console.  
In a bundled application:

- Linux: `~/.config/MysteriumVPN/logs/*.log`
- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/MysteriumVPN/*.log`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\MysteriumVPN\logs\*.log`

### Node

`~/.mysterium/logs/mysterium-node.log`

### Supervisor

- Linux/macOS: `/var/log/myst_supervisor.log`
- Windows: `%PROGRAMDATA%\MystSupervisor\myst_supervisor.log`

## Getting started (development)

1. Install and build the project
    ```
    yarn && yarn build
    ```
2. Start (webpack dev server with hot reload):

    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

## Using a custom Mysterium Node version

Instead of using prebuilt Node binary (specified by `@mysteriumnetwork/node` version in `package.json`), you may build [Node](https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node) from sources and start it in daemon mode with required permissions, e.g.:

```
git clone https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node
cd node
mage build
mage daemon
```

App will try to connect to the existing instance instead of launching one of its own.

## Packaging for distribution

Required env variables (macOS):
- APPLEID
- APPLEIDPASS (generate an app-specific password for this)

```
yarn bundle
```
